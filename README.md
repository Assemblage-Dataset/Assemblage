# Assemblage

Assemblage is a distributed binary corpus discovery, generation, and archival tool built to provide high-quality labeled metadata for the purposes of building training data for machine learning applications of binary analysis and other applications (static / dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, etc...).  

You can now find our paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03991)  

## Deployment and Dataset Availability

A brief introduction to the APIs is provided at this [link](assemblage/README.md#workers-api-and-deployment), and deployment instructions can be found [here](https://assemblagedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html)

We include __**only**__ the subset of binaries for which permissive licenses can be ascertained, please checkout our [data sheet](https://assemblage-dataset.net/assets/total-datasheet.pdf).
